The original Androids project worked for a while and still works in the simulator I have. I've put a video in there of the project I made up to the point it stopped working. I've been trying for hours now to get the app to build properly, but it doesn't even recognize it as a proper android application. So then I attempted to rebuild it into a new app, which seems to work, but is missing functionality.}
